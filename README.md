# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub

This project is my first work/contribution into a GitHub repository in my own account.

## Build HelloWorld_CPP
To build the C++ project enter into HelloWorld_CPP folder and execute the following commands:
```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../ [extra options]
```

## Runing HelloWorld_PY
To run the Python version of HelloWorld it is necessary to create the `hw_env` environment and enter into HelloWorld_PY folder executing the following commands:
```shell
$ conda env create
$ cd HelloWorld_PY
```
Inside of this folder has the two PyDev project files.
